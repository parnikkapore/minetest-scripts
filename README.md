# minetest-scripts

An archive of Lua and advtrains scripts I use in my Minetest worlds.

## What are each of these?

| Folder | Requirements | Function |
|---|---|---|
| simplex | advtrains | A Lua-based block sectioning system I used before one got implemented in advtrains |
| mtprt1 | advtrains | 1st prototype of my implementation of PRTs in Minetest |
| mtprt2 | advtrains | 2nd prototype of my implementation of PRTs in Minetest |
